# DFT-Turbomole WaNo

The DFT-Turbomole WANO is a workflow automation tool designed for computational chemistry tasks, focusing primarily on hyperpolarizability calculations. This tool facilitates the calculation of various molecular properties, including:
- Geometry optimization
- Frequency calculation
- Excited state calculation
- Hyperpolarizability calculation

These calculations can be performed for molecules in both gas phase and solution environments. However, the primary purpose of this workflow automation tool is to streamline hyperpolarizability calculations, aiding in the screening and assessment of molecular candidates for applications in nonlinear optics and related fields. Figure 1 depicts the workflow layout.

This setup will enable the Wano to extract the initial structures from the `structure file` and perform geometry optimization and frequency calculations. It will generate a new optimized xyz file for the next step.

#  DTF-Turbomole_1 WANO

To perform hyperpolarizability calculations using the DTF-Turbomole_1 WANO, follow these steps:

1. **Open the WANO**: Double-click on the DTF-Turbomole_1 WANO.

2. **Define a Title**: 
    - Click on the title box and name it (see Figure 4, number 1).

3. **Input Structure**: 

4. **Specify the File**:
    - Click on the box next to "Structure file type" under the "molecular structure" section (labeled as 2 in Figure 4). Default is xyz.
    - Click on the box next to "Structure file" under the "Molecular structure" section (labeled as 3 in Figure 4). Note that this is not the same button as the third step in Figure 2.
    - A pop-up will appear where you can select the file from the list. Select the appropriate file "DTF-Turbomole_1/outputs/final_structure.xyz" (see Figure 9, number 4). This will make the WANO take the optimized structure from the DFT-Turbomole WANO as the initial input for hyperpolarizability calculation. 

5. **Type of Calculation**:
    - Check the box next to "Hyperpolarizability" under the "Type of calculation" section (number 5 in Figure 4).
    - A box will appear where you can enter your desired Lambda in nm.
    - If additional frequencies are needed, press the green cross to add another frequency in the new box that appears.
    - If MP2 calculation is needed, click "MP2" button under "Type of Calculation" (in Figure ?). At this point, there is no need to specify the functional in "DFT Options".

**Note**: In this WANO, the default hyperpolarizability calculation is the Pockels effect. For more details, please refer to the parameters explanation.

# Parameters
In this section, we will explain each of the following parameters in detail:
- **Title:** Provide the title of the calculation or project (should be defined as explained in the previous sections).
- **Molecular Structure**
    - _**Structure file type:**_ Specify the type of structure file being used (xyz, Turbomole coord, Gaussian input).
    - _**Structure file:**_ The actual structure file containing the molecular coordinates (should be defined as explained in the previous sections).
    - _**Internal coordinates:**_ Information on the internal coordinates used for defining the molecule.
- **Basis set**
    - _**Basis set type:**_ Specify the type of basis set employed in the calculation.
- **Initial guess**
    - _**Charge:**_ Indicate the total charge of the molecule.
    - _**Multiplicity:**_ Specify the multiplicity of the molecule.
- **DFT options**
    - _**Max SCF iterations:**_ Set the maximum number of SCF (Self-Consistent Field) iterations.
    - _**Use RI:**_ Specify whether the RI (Resolution of Identity) approximation is used.
    - _**Memory for RI:**_ Allocate memory for RI calculations.
    - _**Functional:**_ Specify the DFT functional used.
    - _**Integration grid:**_ Define the integration grid used for the DFT calculations.
    - _**vdw correction:**_ Indicate if van der Waals correction is needed.
    - _**COSMO calculation:**_ Specify if COSMO calculations are needed.
- **Type of calculation**
    - _**Structure optimization:**_ Performing geometry optimization if you select this option. The final structure will be stored in the output directory.
    - _**Excited states calculation:**_ Computing the electronic states of a molecule that are higher in energy than the ground state using the Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) method.
    - _**Hyperpolarizability:**
         - The equation ω₃ = −(ω₁ + ω₂) is fundamental in describing energy conservation in three-wave mixing processes in nonlinear optics. Here are some useful special cases:
           
         - **Second Harmonic Generation (SHG), β(−2ω; ω, ω)**: Two photons of the same frequency (ω) combine to generate a new photon with twice the frequency (2ω). Commonly used in laser technology for frequency doubling.
           
         - **Electro-optic Pockels Effect, β(−ω; ω, 0)**: A light wave (ω) interacts with a static electric field, resulting in modulation of the light wave at the same frequency. Utilized in electro-optic modulators for optical communication systems.
           
         - **Optical Rectification, β(0; ω, −ω)**: Two photons of opposite frequencies (ω and −ω) generate a static (DC) electric field. Used in terahertz wave generation and detection.
         
 Although Turbomole software calculates the hyperpolarizability by default for the second harmonic generation case, this WANO is designed to calculate hyperpolarizability for the Pockels effect.
       
The resulting hyperpolarizability is in atomic units (a.u.). To convert it to esu `\(*10^{30}\)`, use the following relation:

`1 a.u. = \(8.6393 \times 10^{-33}\) esu`



  - _**Frequency calculation:**_ Calculate second derivatives of the energy with respect to nuclear positions. This can be chosen either with the structure optimization parameter or alone.
  - _**Plot HOMO-LUMO orbt:**_  If you need to see the frontier orbitals, selecting this parameter will calculate the related cube files.
